# WindowUtils
 
I wrote this small plugin for a project I'm currently working on.

### Usage
All functions require a window handle as the first argument. To get it, please use the built-in Displayserver singleton [method](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_displayserver.html#class-displayserver-method-window-get-native-handle)
